# mk0
Modularized Keyboard 0

The goal of this project is to build a full-fledged and modularized keyboard from scratch, including PCBs and a case.

# Prelude
The last time I designed a PCB was for the final project of my Bachelor degree, which was almost 4 years ago. Some refreshing on how to design PCB is definetely needed for me. I have found https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide pretty useful as it covers not only general PCB designing but also how keyboards work.

# Roadmap
- PCB design (keyboard + STM32F303)
- Firmware. Probably will use some code from QMK (https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
- Case design
- Fabrication
